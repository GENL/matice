Matice creates a Blade directive that you can include in your views. 
It will export a JavaScript object of your application's translations,
keyed by their names (aliases, lang, filenames, folders name), 
as well as globals trans(), __() and transChoice() helper
functions which you can use to access your translations in your JavaScript.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require genl/matice
```

1. ##### Include our Blade directive (`@translations`) somewhere in your template before your main application JavaScript is loadedâ€”likely in the header somewhere.
1. ##### Publish the vendor if you want to customize config: 
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Genl\Matice\MaticeServiceProvider
```

Matice is available as an NPM `matice` package
which exposes the `trans ()` function for use in frontend applications
that do not use Blade.
You can install the NPM package with:
```bash
// With yarn
yarn add matice

With npm
npm install matice
```

or load it from a CDN:
```html
<!-- Load the Matice translation object first -->
<script defer src="https://unpkg.com/matice@1.1.x/dist/matice.min.js"></script>
```

* Note that the JavaScript package only contains the translations logic. You have to generate your translations file and make 
it available to your frontend app. The blade directive `@translations` will do it for you anytime you reload the page.

**TypeScript support**

Matice is fully written in TypeScript so, it's compatible with TypeScript projects.



## Usage

* ##### Core concepts

Matice comes with almost the same localization concepts as Laravel. 
Read more about [Laravel localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization)

This package uses the `@translations` directive to inject a JavaScript object containing all of your application's translations, keyed by their names. This collection is available globally on the client side in the `window.Matice` object.

The package also creates an optional `trans()` JavaScript helper which works like Laravel's PHP `trans()` helper to retrieve translation strings.


#### Examples

import the `trans()` function like follow:
 ```javascript
import { trans } from "matice";
```

Let's assume we have this translations:

```php
// resources/lang/en/custom.php

return [
    'greet' => [
        'me' => 'Hello!',
        'someone' => 'Hello :name!',
        'me_more' => 'Hello Ekcel Henrich!',
        'people' =>'Hello Ekcel!|Hello everyone!',
    ],
    'balance' => '{0} You're broke|[1000, 5000] a middle man|[1000000,*] You are awesome :name; :count Million Dollars'
];
```

```php
// resources/lang/fr/custom.php

return [
    'greet' => [
        me => 'Bonjour!'
    ]
];
```

#### trans

Retrieve a text:
```javascript
let sentence = ''

sentence = trans('greet.me') // Hello!

// With parameters
sentence = trans('greet.someone', {args: {name: "Ekcel"}}) // Hello Ekcel!
```

#### Update locale

Matice exposes `setLocale` function to change the locale that is used by the `trans` function.
```javascript
import { setLocale } from "matice"

// update the locale
setLocale('fr')
const sentence = trans('greet.me') // Bonjour!
```

#### Pluralization 

On pluralization, the choice depends on the `count` argument. To activate pluralization
pass the argument `pluralize` to true.

```javascript
// Simple pluralization
sentence = trans('greet.people', {args: {count: 0}, pluralize: true}) // Hello Ekcel!
sentence = trans('greet.people', {args: {count: 2}, pluralize: true}) // Hello everyone!

// Advanced pluralization with range. Works the same way.
// [balance => '{0} You're broke|[1000, 5000] a middle man|[1000000,*] You are awesome :name; :count Million Dollars']
sentence = trans('balance', {args: {count: 0}, pluralize: true}) // You're broke
sentence = trans('balance', {args: {count: 3000}, pluralize: true}) // a middle man
```

#### Trans Choice

Matice provides a helper function for pluralization

```javascript
import { transChoice } from "matice"

let sentence = transChoice('balance', 17433085, {name: 'Ekcel'}) // You are awesome Ekcel; 17433085 Million Dollars
```


#### Underscore function
* As well of the `trans()` function, Matice provide `__()` that does the same as the `trans()` function but with this particularity
not to throw an error when the key is not found but returns the key itself.

`transChoice()` always throws an error if the key is not found. To change this behaviour, use `__(key, {pluralize: true})`

```js
sentence = trans('greet.unknown') // -> throws an error with a message.
sentence = __('greet.unknown') // greet.unknown
```

#### Default values

Matice uses your current app locale `app()->getLocale()` a the default locale when generating the translation object with the blade directive `@translations`.
When generating with command line, it use the one in your `config.app`

When Matice does not find a key, it falls back to the default locale and search again. The fallback is the
same you define in your `config.app`.

```php
// config/app.php

'locale' => 'fr',
'fallback_locale' => 'en',
```

#### Retrieve the current locale
Matice exposes the `MaticeLocalizationConfig` class :
```js
import { MaticeLocalizationConfig } from "matice"

const locale = MaticeLocalizationConfig.locale // 'en'

const fallbackLocale = MaticeLocalizationConfig.fallbackLocale // 'en'

const locales = MaticeLocalizationConfig.locales // ['en', 'fr']
```

Matice also provides helpers to deal with locales information:
```js
import { setLocale, getLocale, locales } from "matice"

// Update the locale
setLocale('fr') //

const locale = getLocale() // 'en'

const locales = locales() // ['en', 'fr']
``` 

## Artisan Command
Matice registers an Artisan console command to generate a `matice_translations.js` translations file, which can be used as part of an asset pipeline such as [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/mix).

You can run `php artisan matice:generate` in your project to generate a static translations file in `resources/assets/js/matice_translations.js`.
You can customize the generation path in the `config/matice.php` file.

```sh
php artisan matice:generate
```

An example of `matice_translations.js`, where auth translations exist in `resources/lang/en/auth.php`:

```php
// resources/lang/en/auth.php

return [
    'failed' => 'These credentials do not match our records.',
    'throttle' => 'Too many login attempts. Please try again in :seconds seconds.',
]
```

```js
// matice_translations.js

const Matice = {
    locale: 'en',
    fallbackLocale: 'en',
    translations: {
      en: {
        auth: {
          failed: 'These credentials do not match our records.',
          throttle: 'Too many login attempts. Please try again in :seconds seconds.'
        }
      }
    }
};

export { Matice };
```

At this point you can use in javascript this translations file like usual, paste in your html as well.

This is useful if your laravel and js app is separated like a SPA or PWA. So you can
link the generated translations file and link the file to your JS App. But if it not the case
you might never have to generate the translations manually because `@translations` directive already does
it for you.

## Using with Vue Components

If you want to use the `route()` helper in a Vue component, add this to your `app.js` file:

```javascript
// app.js

import {__, trans, setLocale, getLocale, transChoice, MaticeLocalizationConfig, locales} from "matice"

Vue.mixin({
    methods: {
        $trans: trans,
        $__: __,
        $transChoice: transChoice,
        $setLocale: (locale: string) => {
          setLocale(locale);
          this.$forceUpdate() // Refresh the vue instance after locale change.
        },
        // The current locale
        $locale() {
            return getLocale()
        },
        // A listing of the available locales
        $locales() {
            return locales()
        }
    },
})
```

Then you can use the methods in your Vue components like so:

```html
<p>{{ $trans('greet.me') }}</p>
```

## Dive Deeper

Matice extends the Laravel `Translator` Class. Use `Translator::list()` to returns
an array representation of all of your app translations.

If you want to load only translations of a specfic locale, use the matice facade:
```php
use GENL\Matice\Facades\Matice;

// Or load translations for a specific locale.
$translations = Matice::translations($locale)

// Or all the translations
$translations = Matice::translations()
```


**Environment-based loading of minified matice helper file**

When using the `@translations` Blade directive, Matice detects the current environment and minify the output if `APP_ENV` is `production`. 

In development, `@translations` loops into the lang directory to generate the matice object each time the page reloads, and doesn't generate`matice_translations.js` file. 
In production, `@translations` generate the `matice_translations.js` file for you so the when your app is open for the first time.
Then the generated file is used every time the page reloads so the Matice object is not generated every time. It increases the performance in production.
This behavior can be disabled in the `config/matice.php` file, set `use_generated_translations_file_in_prod` to false.

######**Note: Matice supports with json translation files as well as with php files.**,
