Matice creates a Blade directive that you can include in your views. 
It will export a JavaScript object of your application's translations,
keyed by their names (aliases, lang, filenames, folders name), 
as well as globals trans(), __() and transChoice() helper
functions which you can use to access your translations in your JavaScript.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require genl/matice
```

1. If using Laravel 5.4, add `GENL\Matice\MaticeServiceProvider::class` to the `providers` array in your `config/app.php`.
1. Include our Blade directive (`@translations`) somewhere in your template before your main application JavaScript is loadedâ€”likely in the header somewhere.

Matice is available as a NPM package, matice-js
that exposes the `trans()` function for use in frontend apps that 
are not using Blade. 
You can install the NPM package with:
```bash
npm install matice-js
```

or load it from a CDN:
```html
<!-- Load the Matice translation object first -->
<script defer src="https://unpkg.com/matice-js@1.0.x/dist/js/matice.min.js"></script>
```

* Note that you still have to generate your translation file and make it available to your frontend app by injecting is into you html file or api call or other.

To generate translation file use:

```bash
php artisan matice:generate
```


**TypeScript support**

Matice is fully written in TypeScript. So it is fully compatible with TypeScript Projects



## Usage

* ##### Core concepts

Matice comes with almost the same localization concepts as Laravel does. 
Read more about [Laravel localization](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/localization)

This package uses the `@translations` directive to inject a JavaScript object containing all of your application's translations, keyed by their names. This collection is available at `Matice.translations`.

The package also creates an optional `trans()` JavaScript helper that functions like Laravel's PHP `trans()` helper, which can be used to retrieve translation sentences.

import the `trans()` function like follow:
 ```javascript
import { trans } from "matice";
```

Let's assume we have this Matice object:

```javascript
global.Matice = {
  translations: {
    en: {
      greet: {
        me: "Hello!",
        someone: 'Hello :name!',
        meMore: "Hello Ekcel Henrich!",
        people: "Hello Ekcel!|Hello everyone!",
      },
      balance: "{0} You're broke|[1000, 5000] a middle man|[1000000,*] You are awesome :name; :count Million Dollars"
    },
    fr: {
      greet: {
        me: "Bonjour!"
      }
    }
  },
  "locale": "en",
  "fallbackLocale": "en",
}
```

Retrieve a text:
```javascript
let sentence = ''

sentence = trans('greet.me') // Hello!

// With parameters
sentence = trans('greet.someone', {args: {count: 0, pluralize: true}}) // Hello Ekcel!
sentence = trans('greet.someone', {args: {count: 1, pluralize: true}}) // Hello everyone!

// Advanced pluralization with range
sentence = trans('balance', {args: {count: 0}, pluralize: true}) // You're broke
sentence = trans('balance', {args: {count: 3000}, pluralize: true}) // a middle man
```

Also 

* Pluralization

Pluralization depends on the `count` argument. 

```javascript
// Pluralization
sentence = trans('greet.people', {args: {name: 'Ekcel', pluralize: true}}) // Hello Ekcel!
```

Matice provides a helper function for pluralization

```javascript
import { transChoice } from "matice"

let sentence = transChoice('balance', 17433085, {args: {name: 'Ekcel'}}) // You are awesome Ekcel; 17433085 Million Dollars
```

* As well of the `trans()` function, Matice provide `__()` that does the same as the `trans()` function but with this particularity
not to throw an error when the key is not found but returns an the key itself.

`transChoice()` always throws an error if the key is not found. To change this behaviour, use `__(key, {pluralize: true})`


Matice uses your current app locale `app()->getLocale()` a the default locale when generating the translation object with the blade directive `@translations`.
When generating with command line, it use the one in your `config.app`

When Matice does not find a key, he fallback to the default locale and search again. The fallback is the
same you define in your config.

```php
// config/app.php

'locale' => 'fr',
'fallback_locale' => 'en',
```



* ##### More

Matice extends the Laravel `Translator` Class. Use `Translator::list()` to returns
an array representation of all of your app translations.

If you want to load only translation of a specfic locale, use the matice facade:
```php
$translations = Matice::translations($locale)

// Or all the translations
$translations = Matice::translations()
```
